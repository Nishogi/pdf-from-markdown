# pdf-from-markdown

A fast and efficient way to generate PDF files from Markdown files. Perfect for markdown enjoyers that need to communicate with pdf lovers.

## Get Started

To set up the generation of the PDF files, navigate to your project folder and run the following command:

```bash
git archive --remote=https://github.com/Nishogi/pdf-from-markdown.git | tar -x
```

Now, upon push, the Markdown files in the `docs/md` directory are compiled into a single PDF file and pushed to the `docs` directory.
